## Summary

PerbaikiinAja is an application that facilitates repair service orders with features such as:
- Ordering and managing repair service requests.
- Technician selection (default random assignment, or user selection if the optional feature is implemented).
- Technicians provide estimated repair time and cost.
- Integration with a Payment Gateway and an Email/Notification Server.
- User profile management, review and rating system, and work report management.
- Three primary roles: **Admin**, **Technician**, and **User**.

The system is integrated with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) and code quality checks (SonarQube).

---

## User Roles

- **Admin:** Responsible for overall data management and technician verification.
- **Technician:** Responsible for servicing items, providing repair time estimates, and repair costs.
- **User:** Places service requests for repairs and provides reviews after service completion.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Use Case: Placing a Repair Service Order

- **Order Placement:**
    - The user fills in the details of the item to be repaired (item name, condition, issue description, service date, and coupon option).
    - The user selects a payment method, which will display related information (e.g., bank name and account number).

- **Technician Assignment:**
    - By default, a technician is assigned randomly.
    - *(Optional)* The user may choose a technician from an available list.

- **Order Confirmation:**
    - The technician provides an estimated repair time and cost.
    - The user can either accept or reject the estimation.
        - If rejected, the order is canceled and the user can place a new order.

- **Order Cancellation:**
    - The user can cancel the order if the technician has not yet approved the service request.

### Use Case: Editing Profile

- The user navigates to the profile menu to view complete information (name, profile picture, and other details).
- The user clicks the pencil icon to edit their information.
- Input validation (ensuring non-empty and correctly formatted data) is performed before saving.
- If validation fails, the system displays an error notification.
- Access to the profile page is available only after the user logs in.

---

## Module Flow Examples

### Confirm Repair Services

1. Technician logs in to the application.
2. Technician views all incoming service requests.
3. Technician accepts the order and provides an estimated time and cost.
4. The user accepts or rejects the estimation.
5. Technician performs the service and changes the order status to completed.
6. A service report is generated, and the technician's completed job count is automatically updated.

### Reviews and Rating

1. **Order Completed & Submit Review:**  
   After the order is completed, the user submits a review and rating.
2. **View Reviews:**  
   All reviews are displayed and accessible by both users and admin.
3. **Modify Review (Decision Flow):**
    - Should the review be modified?
        - **No:** The process ends.
        - **Yes:** The user may choose to update or delete their review, while the admin can delete the review directly.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - Profile updates should occur in less than 50 ms.
    - Order processing and notification delivery must be efficient even with large amounts of data.

- **Scalability:**
    - The modular design allows new features to be added without disrupting existing modules.
    - Backend services can scale horizontally.

- **Security:**
    - Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms are required for every endpoint.
    - Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, must be encrypted.

- **Maintainability:**
    - The codebase must be clear, well-documented, and meet quality standards verified by SonarQube.

- **Availability:**
    - The system targets a minimum uptime of 99.9%.

## API Design

| No | API Type   | Scope    | Endpoint                         | Documentation |
|----|------------|----------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| 1  | Public     | Auth     | `/api/auth/register`             | [API Doc](#)  |

## Alternate Solutions & Scalability

- **Alternate Frameworks:**
    - Consider alternative frameworks (e.g., Django for Python) if performance issues arise.
- **Database Alternatives:**
    - Although PostgreSQL (via Supabase) is the primary choice, a NoSQL database may be considered for highly dynamic schemas.
- **Scalability:**
    - The modular architecture supports the addition of features without affecting existing modules.
    - Backend services can scale horizontally with a load balancer.
    - Supabase supports vertical scaling and replication for improved performance.
